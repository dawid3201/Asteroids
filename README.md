# Asteroids
This is an assignment from COPM222 from my University course. <br> For this project I had to write a simple Asteroid game in Unity using C#.
## Description

The program is very simple as Unity did most of thr work for me. The goal is simple, get enough points to win.<br>
In my game there are 3 entities: Player, Alien and Asteroids. <br>
* Player can shot, once user's bullet hits asteroids it gets split into smaller pieces and user gains points. User can also shot at alien ship and gain additional points.<br>
* Alien can also shot. There are 3 Alien ships in the game, it has very simple AI implemented which will make Player it's primary target and will move towards if Player is close enough. If Player is not close ALien will shoot asteroids.<br>
* Asteroids spawn randomly on the map and once it htis the Player, they lose health. Asteroids can bounce off the walls and they move with different speed depending on their size.
